# iris_prediction_project
Iris flower classification web app built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## Overview

An interactive machine learning web app for classifying Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, this project demonstrates ML deployment in a simple and intuitive way.

## Key Features

Web-based UI built with Streamlit

User inputs flower measurements and gets prediction instantly

Trained with multiple ML models and evaluated for accuracy

Clean workflow: data preprocessing → training → deployment

## Technologies Used

IDE: PyCharm

Language: Python

Libraries: Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Dataset

Iris dataset (Scikit-learn / UCI Repository)

4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width

Target: Species → Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## Results

Achieved 95%+ accuracy on test data

Deployed ML pipeline as a Streamlit app
